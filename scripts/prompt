This Pull Request introduces several key functionalities aimed at enhancing the user authentication and verification process in the SkyDeck Control Center (CC).

   - Configured necessary settings in` + "`settings.py`" + `for handling signups.
   - Updated the signup template to include terms of use and privacy policy agreements.

   - Created views and templates for displaying SMS verification instructions.

3. **Additional Updates**:
   - Added tests for new models, views, and middleware to ensure robust functionality.
